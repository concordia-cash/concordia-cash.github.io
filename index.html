<h3>Subtitle: Burning the Past by Forging a New Autonomous Future</h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Concordia Curators – concordia.curators@gmail.com<br/>
<strong>Status:</strong> Draft v0.2 – Open for Review<br/>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-06-19  </p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The DECENOMY ecosystem began as a loosely coordinated collection of independent blockchains. Over time, however, its centralization around a single leadership figure led to its collapse. Decisions were made unilaterally, with a small inner circle controlling infrastructure, and there were no formal governance processes through which communities could intervene or redirect the project. When that leadership became inactive, the ecosystem stalled. Development stopped, community members lost access to exchange infrastructure, and no one had the authority or tools to restore momentum. What could have become a thriving federated system deteriorated into fragmented, stagnant chains with diminishing relevance.</p>
<p>This kind of failure is not unique to DECENOMY. Governance remains one of the most unresolved challenges in blockchain architecture. Even prominent Layer 1 projects struggle with this. Ethereum, for example, relies on informal social consensus shaped by core developers and the Ethereum Foundation. ETH holders do not have formal voting rights. Instead, decisions are made in meetings and chats among developers and then implemented through hard forks. Vitalik Buterin, although he is not officially in charge, still holds considerable influence, especially within the Ethereum Foundation. This centralized leadership focused on a single person and lacking a token holder voting mechanism continues to raise concerns about the project’s decentralization and legitimacy.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a radically minimalist governance model, where its protocol is famously resistant to change, and BTC holders have no way to vote, propose updates, or express collective intent. Protocol changes are often chosen to be included by a small, selected, elite group of developers that must be adopted by a critical mass of miners and node operators through consensus in practice, not by design. While this has helped preserve Bitcoin’s resilience and neutrality, it has also led to protocol stagnation and a lack of innovation, as well as internal conflicts over controversial upgrades. Coin holders are spectators rather than participants.</p>
<p>Tezos provides an entirely different example. As one of the first chains to implement formal on-chain governance, it empowers its XTZ holders to propose and vote directly on upgrades. Its self-amending protocol allows it to evolve without hard forks. Every successful proposal can include funding mechanisms for contributors, ensuring a sustainable development cycle. Tezos proves that it is possible to design a Layer 1 chain where decisions are made transparently, collectively, and without dependence on off-chain authority.</p>
<p>Concordia Cash takes inspiration from this more democratic model. It transitions from a failed governance system, or the lack thereof, to a 180-degree turn where it is being rebuilt with a clear commitment to coin-holder sovereignty. Its DAO-first structure ensures that the community decides everything, from technical upgrades and protocol rules to budget allocation and team roles. Concordia is not just another chain. It is a response to the governance failures of the past and a demonstration of what community-led cryptocurrency can look like.</p>
<h2>The Concordia Proposal</h2>
<p>Concordia Cash is the community's answer to the systemic governance failures detailed above. Rather than continuing to operate within chains that lack transparency, leadership, and long-term viability, Concordia offers a clean break and a constructive path forward. It consolidates fractured coin communities into a single, actively maintained blockchain governed by the very people who use it.</p>
<p>The Concordia chain is more than a fork. It is a coordinated migration effort led by contributors who were once investors in the failed ecosystem. At its core is a proposal to revive abandoned value through a trustless, verifiable burn-and-mint process. Holders of legacy coins may voluntarily destroy them by sending to burn addresses published by the Concordia curators. Once confirmed on-chain, the holder is eligible to receive an equal amount of CNCD coins on the new Concordia network. This mechanism ensures that no new value is arbitrarily created, and that migration is grounded in transparency, proof, and fairness.</p>
<p>The project is built on the DSW codebase, selected for its modularity and reliability. However, Concordia is not simply a rebranded technical clone. From genesis, it integrates DAO-first governance and enforces the separation of power through code. All decision-making is vested in the hands of coin holders, not developers or curators. Protocol rules, network upgrades, funding allocations, and contributor roles are all subject to binding DAO proposals and votes.</p>
<p>To help launch the chain and facilitate the migration phase, a small group of initial curators has been appointed. These curators do not hold privileged authority and may be removed by DAO vote at any time. Their role is temporary and procedural: to bootstrap infrastructure, audit burn proofs, maintain communication channels, and assist in establishing the DAO's initial operational flow.</p>
<p>Concordia does not claim to be novel for its technology. Its strength lies in governance. Where previous chains silenced their communities and concentrated influence in opaque leadership, Concordia builds decision-making into the protocol itself. It is designed to be community-run, community-funded, and community-secured.</p>
<p>The Concordia Proposal is ultimately a collective act of reclamation. It transforms abandoned coins into building blocks for a new, autonomous future, one where governance is not a feature added later, but a foundation laid from the start.</p>
<h2>The Curators' Role</h2>
<p>At the genesis of the Concordia Cash network, a temporary group of contributors known as curators has been appointed to assist with launching the project and guiding the community through its early transition phase. These curators are not founders, executives, or permanent authorities. They are technical facilitators and community stewards, acting under a limited mandate defined by the Concordia DAO and bound to its authority from the beginning.</p>
<p>The curators’ responsibilities are narrowly scoped and explicitly defined. Their primary duties include publishing and maintaining burn addresses for each supported legacy coin, verifying burn proofs, authorizing CNCD coin issuance through the migration tool, and supporting core infrastructure such as seed nodes, block explorers, and wallets. They may also help coordinate communication with developers, exchanges, and community members to ensure the stability and continuity of the network during its bootstrapping phase.</p>
<p>Curators do not have control over protocol rules, funding decisions, treasury assets, or any strategic direction. They have no budget or central fund to operate from. All financial matters, including exchange listing fees, development grants, infrastructure costs, and marketing budgets, must be approved and allocated by the DAO through formal proposals and on-chain voting. The same applies to defining project priorities, initiating partnerships, or committing to major strategic efforts.</p>
<p>If the DAO votes to pursue a funded initiative, such as an exchange listing that requires a payment, curators may assist in executing the technical components, such as integration support or communication with listing teams. However, the financial responsibility must come from the DAO, not from the curators. In limited cases, the DAO may approve a donation address for community-led fundraising, and curators may be asked to manage or supervise that process under full transparency.</p>
<p>Ideally, the DAO will include or recruit qualified volunteers capable of handling coordination, business development, and technical interfacing with external platforms. The curators' role is to support, not to lead or fund such efforts.</p>
<p>In addition to operational and technical duties, curators are also responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the Concordia project. While fully accountable to the DAO and subject to its decisions, curators are required to ensure that all DAO-approved actions comply with the Concordia Constitution and governing framework. If any proposal or vote violates those foundational rules, curators must veto it. These vetoes are not discretionary. Each one must be publicly justified, with references to the relevant constitutional clauses or principles being upheld.</p>
<p>This mechanism is designed as a safeguard, not a source of power. It protects the DAO from unconstitutional behavior during its formative stages without undermining the authority of coin holders.</p>
<p>Curators may also assist in proposing the initial governance structures and submitting foundational DAO proposals to formalize roles, budgets, and procedures. However, all final decisions rest with the DAO, not the curators.</p>
<p>As Concordia matures and the DAO becomes fully autonomous, the need for curators will diminish. Their responsibilities will be phased out, and their positions may be modified, replaced, or revoked entirely by DAO vote at any time.</p>
<p>The curators exist to serve, not to rule. They do not fund the project. They do not define its future. Their authority is limited, their presence temporary, and their only mandate is to uphold the will of the community and the integrity of the chain.</p>
<h2>Concordia Constitution</h2>
<p>The Concordia Constitution is the foundational framework of the DAO. It defines the rules, limits, and responsibilities that govern the Concordia Cash ecosystem, ensuring that power remains in the hands of the community and that all participants operate under a transparent and enforceable structure.</p>
<p>Unlike informal or off-chain governance systems, the Constitution is an explicit, binding document. It outlines the rights of masternode owners, the obligations of curators, the authority of the DAO, and the mechanisms by which decisions must be made and enforced. This document serves as the legal and procedural backbone of Concordia’s governance.</p>
<p>Curators are bound to uphold the Constitution. They must veto any DAO-approved action that violates its rules and provide a public, clause-based justification. However, curators themselves are not above the Constitution. Their vetoes may be challenged by the DAO and overridden with sufficient consensus. This layered system protects the DAO from internal abuse without creating new points of centralization.</p>
<p>The Constitution is also a living document. It may be amended through DAO proposals that meet high quorum and approval thresholds, ensuring that change is possible but not easily manipulated.</p>
<p>Below is the initial version of the Concordia Constitution, present at project launch.</p>
<h2>Initial Constitution</h2>
<p><strong>Article I.</strong> The Concordia DAO holds the ultimate authority over the project.</p>
<p><strong>Article II.</strong> Each Concordia masternode grants voting power to its registered owner. Masternode ownership must be verifiable on-chain and subject to technical and collateral requirements defined by DAO governance.</p>
<p><strong>Article III.</strong> All proposals must follow the submission, quorum, and voting procedures defined in the DAO governance rules.</p>
<p><strong>Article IV.</strong> The DAO has exclusive authority to allocate funds, approve development, manage listings, and define strategic direction.</p>
<p><strong>Article V.</strong> Curators are temporary contributors without ownership, executive power, or privileged access.</p>
<p><strong>Article VI.</strong> Curators must fully obey all DAO-approved decisions that comply with the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Article VII.</strong> Curators must veto any DAO-approved action that violates the Constitution. Vetoes must be issued promptly and documented.</p>
<p><strong>Article VIII.</strong> All vetoes must include a public, written justification referencing the specific article or rule violated.</p>
<p><strong>Article IX.</strong> Any veto may be challenged and overturned through a supermajority DAO override proposal, requiring at least 66% participation and 75% approval.</p>
<p><strong>Article X.</strong> Curators may assist with operational tasks such as publishing burn addresses, verifying burn proofs, maintaining infrastructure, and coordinating technical processes.</p>
<p><strong>Article XI.</strong> Curators may not access or control any DAO treasury funds under any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Article XII.</strong> Actions involving payment or resource allocation, including exchange listings, must be proposed, authorized, and funded by the DAO.</p>
<p><strong>Article XIII.</strong> The DAO may approve donation-based campaigns to support specific initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Article XIV.</strong> Donation addresses must be publicly listed, auditable, and may only be managed by curators if explicitly authorized by DAO vote.</p>
<p><strong>Article XV.</strong> Curators must use secure, transparent methods such as multi-signature or escrow systems when handling donation funds.</p>
<p><strong>Article XVI.</strong> All development, marketing, listings, and partnerships must be proposed and approved by the DAO prior to execution. No official activity may proceed without DAO authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Article XVII.</strong> Any Concordia participant may submit a proposal, subject to the governance rules defined by the DAO.</p>
<p><strong>Article XVIII.</strong> The Constitution may be amended through a valid constitutional proposal approved by the DAO. Amendments require a minimum quorum of 66% of active masternodes and at least 75% approval.</p>
<p><strong>Article XIX.</strong> All governance processes and decisions must be transparent, permanently recorded, and publicly auditable.</p>
<p><strong>Article XX.</strong> Concordia coin holders have the right to submit proposals, vote on governance matters, and inspect all public project records.</p>
<p><strong>Article XXI.</strong> No central authority, development team, or curator may override the will of the DAO under any circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>Article XXII.</strong> In the event of a dispute or conflict over interpretation or enforcement of this Constitution, the DAO may initiate a binding arbitration vote to determine resolution.</p>
<h3>The Burn Process</h3>
<p>The Burn Process is the mechanism by which value is migrated from abandoned chains into the Concordia Cash network. It is a public, verifiable, and irreversible process. Users voluntarily destroy their legacy coins to receive CNCD coins, committing to the new chain and its governance in the process.</p>
<h4>Why Concordia Does Not Use Snapshots</h4>
<p>Snapshot-based or message-signing methods may seem simple, but they lack any real commitment. A user could claim CNCD coins without giving up the original ones. This opens the door to short-term profit-seeking, governance manipulation, and inflation through duplication.</p>
<p>There is no cost to participate. There is no accountability. It allows users to extract value without supporting the project.</p>
<p>By contrast, the burn model ensures that participation is deliberate. The user takes an action that cannot be reversed. The burn is permanent and visible to all. There is no duplication. The user either exits the old system or remains outside Concordia. There is no middle ground.</p>
<h4>How the Burn Works</h4>
<p>Users send their legacy coins to a specific, well-known burn address on the original chain. These addresses are generated deterministically and are unspendable. No one, including curators or developers, can access the funds sent there.</p>
<p>The list of burn addresses can be retrieved using the <code>getburnaddresses</code> RPC command on the source chain. If multiple addresses are returned, the DAO will select the official one and the curators will publish it accordingly.</p>
<p>Once the burn transaction is completed, the curators verify the burn and issue the equivalent amount of CNCD coins to the user’s wallet address on the Concordia chain. Every minting event is logged and publicly auditable.</p>
<p>Burns on the Concordia chain itself will be marked using an OP_RETURN to ensure they are permanent and easy to verify.</p>
<h4>Timeline and Allocation</h4>
<p>A total of sixteen billion CNCD coins are reserved for the burn process. This supply will not be used for anything else.</p>
<p>The burn window remains open for six months after the launch of the chain. During this time, users can migrate their coins at a one-to-one ratio.</p>
<p>In the final ten weeks of the burn period, the conversion rate will decrease gradually. Each week, curators will destroy ten percent of the remaining unclaimed CNCD supply. At the same time, the burn ratio will decrease by ten percent each week. By the end of the tenth week, no more conversions will be allowed.</p>
<p>Any CNCD coins that remain unclaimed at the end of the six-month window will be permanently destroyed.</p>
<h4>Consent Through Action</h4>
<p>Burning legacy coins is not only a technical action. It is a formal agreement to enter the Concordia network under the rules of its Constitution. By burning, the user accepts Concordia's governance structure, community ownership model, and proposal system.</p>
<p>The burn process ensures fairness, transparency, and real commitment. There are no shortcuts. There is no duplication. If you wish to join Concordia, you prove it with action.</p>

<li>Use Concordia Green as the primary call-to-action color across digital interfaces.</li>
<li>Secondary colors should support, not overpower, the primary palette, ensuring brand hierarchy remains clear.</li>
<li>Always test color combinations for legibility, especially considering users with color vision deficiencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consistent typography ensures readability and a cohesive visual language that aligns with our modern, trustworthy identity.</p>
<h3>3.1 Primary Font: Montserrat</h3>
<p>Montserrat is our primary font. Its geometric forms and clean lines reflect modernity and stability, aligning with the 'C' in our logo (which was inspired by Montserrat Bold). It is highly versatile and should be used for headlines, subheadings, and prominent text elements.</p>

<p>Available via https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans</p>
<p><strong>Key Weights:</strong>
- <strong>Open Sans Bold (700)</strong> - For emphasis within body copy.

<h3>3.4 Web Font Implementation</h3>
<p>EEnsure fonts are loaded efficiently to maintain optimal performance across platforms. </p>
<p>Use Google Fonts CDN links in HTML for reliable delivery and ease of implementation. </p>
<p>Always specify fallback fonts (e.g., <code>sans-serif</code>) in your CSS to ensure readability even if fonts fail to load.</p>
<p><code>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800;900&amp;family=Open+Sans:wght@300;400;600;700&amp;display=swap" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></p>
<h2>4. Imagery &amp; Visual Style</h2>
<p>Imagery and visual assets should consistently reinforce the <strong>CONCORDIA CASH</strong> brand values, conveying professionalism, innovation, clarity, and approachability.</p>
<h3>4.1 Photography Principles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Style:</strong> Authentic, modern, and optimistic. Avoid overly staged or generic stock photos. Focus on natural lighting and clean compositions.</li>
<li><strong>Subject Matter:</strong> Depict concepts like secure transactions, global connectivity, community interaction, and the positive impact of financial technology. Images of people interacting with technology or abstract representations of secure networks are preferred.</li>
<li><strong>Color Tone:</strong> Photography should generally align with the brand's primary and secondary color palette, featuring natural lighting and clear compositions to maintain visual harmony.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.2 Illustration &amp; Iconography</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Style:</strong> Clean, geometric, and minimalist. Line art or flat design illustrations are preferred. Icons should be simple, intuitive, and instantly recognizable. The style should echo the precision of the logo and Montserrat typeface.</li>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Primarily use Concordia Green and Concordia White. Limited and intentional use of secondary colors (Concordia Blue, Grey, Accent Gold) is permissible for emphasis or categorization, ensuring they do not overpower the primary palette.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> All icons and illustrations should belong to a unified set, maintaining consistent stroke weights, corner radii, and overall visual language to ensure a cohesive visual system.</li>
</ul>
